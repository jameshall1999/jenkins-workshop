# An Introduction to Jenkins & Continous Integration

Just a little something to introduce some people to CI/CD with Jenkins

## Requirements

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), check you have both with this command...

    docker -v && docker-compose -v 

## Preparation

Fork https://github.com/WillGibson/jenkins-workshop to your GitHub account, clone your fork. to your machine and `cd jenkins-workshop`.

## Sample App

A hacked together Flask API in a docker container

Build: `./build.sh`

Run: `./run.sh`

Test: `./dockertest.sh`

## Jenkins

### Setting up Jenkins

* Move into the `jenkins` folder `cd jenkins`

* Fire up Jenkins in a Docker container with Docker Compose `docker-compose up`

* Hit http://localhost:8080/ and log in with the admin password you got in the output from the previous command

* Install suggested plugins

* Create your admin user and click through past "Save and continue"

### Setting up our pipeline

* Click "Create a job"

* Enter a name, select "Pipeline" and click "OK"

* General

  * Check "Do not allow concurrent builds"

  * Check "GitHub project" and enter the URL "https://github.com/<your_github_username>/jenkins-workshop"
  
  * Check "This project is parameterised"
  
    * Select "String parameter"
    * Enter "BRANCH" for the name
    * Enter "master" as the default

* Build Triggers

  * Ignore this for now
  
* Advanced Project Options

  * Ignore this for now

* Pipeline

  * Select "Pipeline script from SCM" (Source Code Management)
  
  * Enter the repository URL "https://github.com/<your_github_username>/jenkins-workshop"
  
  * Delete the "Branch Specifier" (so it can build any branch based on the branch parameter)
  
  * Uncheck "Lightweight checkout"

* Click "Save"

## Deploying to Heroku

* (Create a Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/login)

* Create a Heroku app

* Set the stack of your app to container `heroku stack:set container`

* Connect the app to your Git repository

* Create a deploy key

  * `cd .ssh`
  * `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`
  * `cd ../`
  
* Add the deploy key to you GitHub repo with write access

### Useful commands

* Log into the jenkins container `docker exec -it jenkins_workshop /bin/bash`

* Run the Jenkins container in the background `docker-compose up -d`

* Stop the Jenkins container if you ran it in the background `docker-compose down`
